Thank for DDNet Project (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet) and the effort done by eeeee (https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet)

I change the compile_to_js file and build some js, but it can not run normally. So I use ddnet_*.js file from http://teewebs.net, and do some hack, then serve it using github page.

Now you can access the ddnet web client from http://tee.teeeeee.tk/
